this is a very small script to check, extract and save the daily horoscope in a text file.
User has to provide the moth and date in "June 23" format.
Also, use has to provide the zodiac sign name.

This is a little slow (takes around ~10 mins) script, because of the 'load' event on the website's difeerent pages vary from 1 min to 1.3 mins.
